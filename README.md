Group 8's Final Project - Member: Melvin Lin

# Proposal 
Project Slide: 15

**Motivation**
To efficiently distribute charges to a group of people for grocery shopping, trips, and many other scenarios, I will be using the dataset various sources online to achieve this. 

**Research Questions**
How to efficiently and accurately distribute charges amongst a group of people?
How does different ways of splitting the receipts affect this?
How does different currencies and types of receipts affect the application?

**Datasets**

**Deliverables**
* utilize a receipt as the ground zero to have NGL and image processing to look through
* ensure that it works on a larger dataset of receipts and a variety as well
* create an application that allows users to select the items that they bought and aggregate a price for them

# Original Proposal
My suite makes 2-3 Costco trips per semester, and usually, one person pays for everything at the counter, and we sort out what belongs to who later. This isnâ€™t a difficult task, but it is rather tedious and error-prone especially because we share many items.

I am hoping to build an interface to allow a user to submit an image of a receipt in which the program proceeds to break down all the items and the associated costs. Then the user is able to assign the appropriate quantity to the correct purchaser.

For this project, I believe many images of receipts from different stores will be needed. I am not quite sure where this might be available...

The deliverable will be a pitch/presentation for this idea in addition to the program.
